# Notes:
#    All sections are optional!
#    Run Loop is often used in more complicted projects such as games
#    Code does not have to loop!
#    Not all code has to be contained within a function!

# Language Definitions:
#    1. Persistent Memory; refers to a file at the main file's location containing data
#    2. File; refers to a file at any location containg data
#    3. Temporary Memory; refers to data stored temporarily, in the main file, while the main file is running; Examples: Variable, Function, Etc
#    4. Run Loop; When code is seperated into functions and then the functions are run

# Pros & Cons:

#   Pros:
#       1. Allows for easy reuse / repeating of sections of the code

#   Cons:
#       1. Can be harder to read / write as a developer

# Uses:
#    1. Games; Reasons: More robust functions
#    2. Complicated operations; Reasons: More robust functions
